           Hello there! I'm a dedicated front-end web developer who thrives on transforming creative ideas into captivating digital experiences. My journey into the tech world began with a solid educational foundation â€“ I hold a degree in Software Engineering from Salahaddin University. Eager to put my knowledge into action, I ventured into the realm of education, working as an assistant lecturer at Charmo University. During this time, I not only deepened my understanding of technology but also honed my communication skills. Following my passion for web development, I took on the challenge of the WeCode Front-End Bootcamp and later the comprehensive Bit Fullstack Bootcamp. These experiences equipped me with a strong command of tools like React and a holistic understanding of full-stack development. With a blend of academic excellence and hands-on coding skills, I'm committed to crafting user-centric interfaces that seamlessly merge aesthetics with functionality.
